Most roads are quite boring, which is not exactly a hot take. However, some roads are more interesting than others, for a variety of reasons. Having run an awful lot of them so far, certain ones still stick in my mind. Here is a list of them in no particular order.

### 1. Moon Grove, Rusholme

This is a lovely little cobbled cul-de-sac only 30 seconds from the Curry Mile in Rusholme. I enjoyed this one because it was so unexpected in that part of the city, I'd probably not have given it as much attention had it been further south in the suburbs.

Unfortunately Street View doesn't quite do it justice but hopefully it gives a glimpse of its charm:

### 2. St. Martin's Avenue, Heaton Norris

Another cul-de-sac, this one  very steep. Reaching the end of this road felt like an achievement and also had the feeling of being in an ampitheatre.

The run on which I completed this road was unexpectedly hilly.

### 3. Octagonal avenues, Withington

Hassall, Rudheath, Mouldsworth and Dennison Avenue comprise two distinctive octagons in Withington:

These roads make the list purely because the pattern they create is so distinctive. Honourable mention to these very similar circular roads in Burnage:

### 4. Victoria Avenue East, North Manchester

I ran Victoria Avenue East on the run with the most new distance so far, 23.3km, on 13th December 2020. I remember it was a horrible, drizzly day. I ran out of the city centre along Oldham Road till it meets the M60, then along the full length of Victoria Avenue East in a westerly direction until Heaton Park, before meandering back to the city centre.

I enjoy these long straight roads with relatively few junctions for their length. Aside from this I also have good memories because I walked along it in 2015 when I completed the [Bogle Stroll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogle_Stroll), a 55-mile charity walk. The Bogle route is a rough figure of 8 with one loop in south Manchester and the other, which includes this road, in the north.

### 5. Ten Acres Lane, near Clayton Value, East Manchester

I ran this road on 20th September 2020 when meandering somewhat aimlessly in East Manchester not too far from Manchester City's stadium. It was pure chance that I ended up on this winding road. From just looking on a map it looks fairly non-descript, however the interesting bit was the junction with Riverpark Road:

This junction is really, really wide, especially considering that it's probably not that busy a road.

Extra points for the bridge over the entrance to Clayton Vale. This road remains one of the furthest into Clayton and Droylesden that I've completed.

### 6. Any residential street with a cherry blossom

A cherry blossom tree during summer elevates any street. Ranworth Avenue is just one example that I remember. I ran along Mersey Road again recently (during winter) and it looked like any other residential cul-de-sac.
