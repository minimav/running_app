A belated update after a bit of a break post-Manchester marathon. I decided to switch up areas from Levenshulme/Reddish earlier in the year to Eccles and Salford. For the most part I used a spur of the Bridgewater Canal to get to the Barton Road Bridge, which takes 30-40 minutes in each direction.

**Progress April 2023 to mid July 2023: 43.09% -> 44.66%**

### Run 1 - 2023-05-21

First run adding new roads for almost 2 months, near Barton Road Bridge. I was last in this area on 2022-04-03 when I did some an estate to the west right next to the M60 boundary.

| *2023-05-21 run added 2.7km of new road, 43.20% total completion. Start and end along Bridgewater Canal not shown.* |

### Run 2 - 2023-05-28

Very close to the week before plus a longer loop up to Eccles town centre and back. I often do this for areas that I don't know very well - run the main roads to form a mental map of the area prior to filling in the smaller roads in the near future.

| *2023-05-28 run added 3.4km of new road, 43.34% total completion. Start and end along Bridgewater Canal not shown.* |

### Run 3 - 2023-06-04

Filling in an area right next to the canal within the long loop I ran the week prior.

### Run 4 - 2023-06-18

Again, filling in more of the roads within the long loop to Eccles from 2023-05-28.

### Run 5 - 2023-06-25

This time to the west of Barton Road Bridge, almost abutting the estate I had done in 2022 which is just in view on the extreme left of the image.

| *2023-06-25 run added 1.8km of new road, 43.67% total completion. Start and end along Bridgewater Canal not shown.* |

### Run 6 - 2023-07-02

A bit further afield from Barton Road Bridge through Patricroft and under the M602 twice.

| *2023-07-02 run added 3.5km of new road, 43.81% total completion. Start and end along Bridgewater Canal not shown.* |

### Run 7 - 2023-07-09

A big loop through Winton, Worsley and Monton before ending in Eccles town centre near the tram stop. Other than Monton, which I had run through on 2021-08-18, all of this was unseen territory for me.

| *2023-07-09 run added 9.6km of new road, 44.21% total completion. Start along Bridgewater Canal not shown.* |

### Run 8 - 2023-07-16

Taking a break from going across the Barton Road Bridge, I went past Old Trafford into Salford with a view to running some of the main roads. I ended up doing a grid estate and some roads near Weaste tram stop that I hadn't previously. One of which was an unpaved industrial road which I didn't realise was a cul-de-sac!
