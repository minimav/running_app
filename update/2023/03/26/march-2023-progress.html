    <p>I ran a 10k race at the start of March which meant a first long run nearly halfway through the month. However, I was in the middle of marathon training, which meant that long runs were longer than usual, with plenty of opportunity to run new roads.</p>

<p><strong>Progress this month: 41.84% -&gt; 43.09%</strong></p>

<h3 id="run-1---2023-03-12">Run 1 - 2023-03-12</h3>

<p>For my first run this month I once again used the Fallowfield Loop at the start of the run and ended at East Didsbury tram stop. My focus here was in three locations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Cleaning up a small collection of roads near to the roundabout at the top of Kingsway which I’d missed previously.</li>
  <li>Completing some roads just east of Stockport Road in the heart of Levenshulme.</li>
  <li>Some more roads east of Stockport Road slightly south of Levenshulme, which are in an easy to remember configuration.</li>
</ol>

<p>I ended up also doing a small new-build estate on the way to the tram stop at the end of the run.</p>

<p>Usually I roughly plan which roads I’m going to run, but on longer runs it is very easy to lose my bearings (and looking at a map is cheating!). Splitting up the run into these three sections, which you can see below, helps with remembering where to go immensely.</p>

      <td style="text-align: center"><em>2023-03-12 run added 9.8km of new road, 42.27% total completion. Start on Fallowfield Loop and end at East Didsbury tram stop not shown.</em></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3 id="run-2---2023-03-19">Run 2 - 2023-03-19</h3>

<p>This was the second longest run of my marathon training, with a total length of ~30km. In this run my aim was to clean up a few roads near to last week’s run, then complete roads to the east of Broom Lane between the Fallowfield Loop in the south and Barlow Road in the north.</p>

<p>After that I did some roads north of Longford Road West – complementing ones I did last month to the south of it – then followed Reddish Road and eventually Manchester Road. I’d intended to exit the big roundabout onto Belmont Way but lost my bearings and ended up running more north-west than I had planned.</p>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3 id="run-3---2023-03-26">Run 3 - 2023-03-26</h3>

<p>This was the longest run of marathon training, about 2 hours 45 minutes in duration. I ran the whole length of the Fallowfield Loop both outwards and back, which is ~14 miles. In between I did some roads in Fairfield, an area which I’ve hardly touched so far.</p>

<p>The grid pattern of roads that I ran in Fairfield is one that makes remembering the route very easy.</p>
